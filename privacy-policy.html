    <h1>Privacy Policy for TinyBudget</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TinyBudget ("we", "our", or "the app") is a baby expense tracker built by Nishant Gupta. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how TinyBudget handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>TinyBudget does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>All data you enter into the app — including expenses, child profiles, budgets, and receipt photos — is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. No data is sent to any server, cloud service, or third party.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored in a local database on your device. This data is accessible only to the TinyBudget app and is not shared with any other application. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be permanently deleted.</p>

    <h2>Backup and Export</h2>
    <p>TinyBudget provides optional features to export your data as a CSV file or share a database backup. These actions are initiated entirely by you, and the exported files are handled by your device's sharing system. We do not have access to any exported data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>TinyBudget does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any similar technologies.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>TinyBudget may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you budget alert reminders. This is optional and can be disabled at any time through your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>While TinyBudget is designed to track baby-related expenses, the app does not collect any personal information about children. Child profile names are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted externally.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
